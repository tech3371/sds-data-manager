    This file system can be mounted by multiple resources. It
    will be attached to AWS resources that run the
    models (ECS, EC2, Lambda) and produce output data.  It will
    also be mounted by the visualizer app to view that model data.
    This allows model data to be seamlessly transferred between
    resources without having to push/pull from s3. For the
    visualizer display, it should have decent I/O capabilities
    to read and write the model output data to the frontend quickly.

    NOTE: The EFS file systems will not be removed during a CDK
    destroy. This is a protection mechanism to
    prevent data from being deleted. After destroying this
    stack you will need to manually delete these
    resources via the AWS console or CLI.
