"""Download packet data from webpoda and compare it against production.

This module downloads newly arrived instrument packet data from webpoda, either
for whole days (download_daily_data) or for individual repointings
(download_repointing_data), based on Spacecraft Time (SCT). For any
instrument/date (and repointing, if applicable) that already has an L0 file in
production, the freshly downloaded data is compared against that file via
_compare_and_write_new_data (which uses _compare_files), so only new or
changed data is kept and returned.
